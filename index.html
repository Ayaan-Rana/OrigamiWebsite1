        <p><i> Interesting facts about cicadas</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
            <li> They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>
            <li> Their predators, or animals that will eat them, don’t know they’re coming. Lots of animals, including birds, mice and raccoons, are in for a bug surprise!</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i> Interesting facts about chameleons</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chameleons actually change their color due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
            <li>Chameleons have eyes in the back of their heads. Compare this to humans: our eyes are on the front of our heads, giving us a narrower field of vision, but a better perception of depth. This singles us out as more predatory than our chameleon friends – though as we’ll see, they also have vision excellently adapted to being a predator.</li>
            <li>Chameleons’ tongues are extremely quick and powerful, sometimes exceeding accelerations of 41g. This means they can grab their prey within fractions of a second, making it impossible to get away. If humans could do this, it would make grabbing that last biscuit from the tin much easier!</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i> Interesting facts about camels</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!</li>
            <li>When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.</li>
            <li>Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!</li>
        </ul>
